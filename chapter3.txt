I am now a senior developer after 3 years and I love this job earning more than I can imagine. Starting to think of making 
my own clothing brand and earning passive income, buying some lots and some units to earn more for a better future.
I have started to crush my vision board with only some of my dreams/visions left. Able to fly to countries i want with my
family,relatives and friends. A good life indeed.
